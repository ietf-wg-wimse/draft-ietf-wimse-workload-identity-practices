      "body": "Following the discussion on the mailing list, I wanted to give my take on the different options to provision the workload with the token.  Maybe we can use it to start the discussion before starting the PR. \r\n\r\nIdentity provision mechanisms:\r\nCurrent workload systems mainly rely on three solution to provide the Identity to a running workload:\r\n1. Environmental variables: they provide the easiest solution to inject the container with information, but presents some drawbacks:\r\n* Static nature: the information are injected when the container is started and cannot be modified at runtime\r\n * Access control: restricting access to environmental variable is more challenging and are usually exposed inside logs and to debugging tools\r\nENV variables should be used with short-live credentials, when simplicity is a requirement.\r\n2. Volumes, i.e., Projected volumes as named in Kubernetes, offer the possibility to pass information through the file-system. This allows to inject dynamical credentials, rotate them and perform a better access control. The main drawbacks of this solution is the additional complexity. Indeed, the solution requires multiple configurations:\r\n* The files need to have a proper access control definition, to prevent the unauthorized access of a different process\r\n* The mounted volume needs to be correctly isolated to prevent a compromised container to be able to gain more control over the host machine\r\n* The additional burden of monitoring the different workload to maintain valid credentials in each container (this last element can be handled by the orchestrator). \r\nThe main advantages of this approach, with respect to the previous one, is in a better access control of the resource and the possibility to rotate the credentials without the need to restart the container. This solution fits well when multiple different process in the container need to access the credential's file.\r\n3. Loopback interface relies on a local endpoint, usually exposing an HTTP or a gRPC interface, to provide the identity information to the workload. This solution, present additional advantages to the cost of complexity:\r\n* Limiting the exposure of the credential thanks to the properties of network isolation in the loopback interface. \r\n* It also allows an on-demand fetching and rotation of the credentials. \r\nNevertheless, there are also some drawback in using this solution:\r\n* The dependency on the network stack, which may differ based on the host machine, and creating a one-for-all solution might require additional code.\r\n* The additional latency due to the request and the increase of the operational overhead.\r\nThis approach should be preferred in conjunction with side-cars/agents and centrally managed identities solutions for application that requires dynamic credentials. \r\n",

They are also defined in OpenID with the strong human identity focus. I'm not sure whether the restriction remains valid here or if we should loosen it. I believe there's a lot of history here and the fact that tokens cannot be differentiated (often `typ=JWT`) doesn't help. So the statement `ID tokens MUST NOT be accepted` is not actionable.\n\nI see the following options: (multiple possible)\n* Deliberately say that the present tokens are \"assertions according to RFC7523 and nothing else\".\n* Add working that explains the situation and also describes how OIDC ID token (don't) fit into the picture.\n* Keep as is and don't allow OIDC ID Tokens.\n* Keep it to OAuth only and don't mention OIDC.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The ID token in the GitHub Actions implementation I refer is an ID token by name only. It doesn't conform to the OIDC spec as its missing a large number of claims. It also is being used outside of the intended use, as it doesn't represent a human identity authentication proof, as you mention. Therefore I agree that ID tokens must not be accepted in the true sense of what one is. \n\nMy remaining question is what is the goal of this document? Is it to refer to existing practices, or to do define a best practice moving forward? Given the pattern I describe is becoming the defacto, at least in the CI/CD space, what's the best way to represent this pattern, even if the token naming is confusing?",

Token Request API which would also require the workload to know how to use this API and to have all permissions to request an access token with the intended audience and so forth, or\r\n2. a service account token projected into the file system, for instance, /var/run/secrets/client-abcde/assertion\r\n\r\nThis approach serves as a protective mechanism against token reuse, misuse, and malicious actions from workloads. By doing this, an AS never receives an assertion it could reply against the Kubernetes API. Additionally, workloads will find it significantly harder (whether intentionally or unintentionally) to share their access tokens with other workloads without detection.\r\n\r\nAs a random note on this, I'm also curious to see how K8s Token Request API would evolve over the time...

      "body": "I reviewed this draft and have the following comments:\n\nNed Smith review of current repo build of draft-ietf-wimse-workload-identity-practices.\n\nSection 3:\n\t- The title of section 3 is specific to OAuth, but \u00a73.2 seems to consider other credential types besides OAuth (but doesn\u2019t include JWT as one of the possible types).\n\nSection 3.2.1:\n\t- S/environmental/environment/ - It is uncommon in Linux to describe environment variables as environmental variables.\n\t\nSection 3.2.2:\n\t- First sentence: \u201cFiles allow to inject\u2026\u201d seems to be missing a word that identifies who or what is doing the injection. Awkward reader flow.\n\t\nSection 3.2.3:\n\t- Last paragraph: S/un-legitimate/illegitimate/ or /unauthorized/\n\nSection 3.3:\n\t- This section indicates \u201cJSON Web Token\u201d is a credential format, but section 3.2 omits it as a possible credential in terms of credential issuance / provisioning techniques. The reader is unclear what the relationship is between the provisioning technique and the format of the provisioned credential. For example, a file could contain a JWT, but also describes OS DAC access mechanisms which typically are not JWT structures. Possibly, JWT should be added to the list in Section 3.2?\n\n\t- For completeness the formatting of all of the credential types listed in \u00a73.2 should be explained in this section? Alternatively, the formatting considerations could be subsections for each credential type listed in \u00a73.2?\n\n\t- Certificates are mentioned as a credential format, but not listed as a credential type in \u00a73.2.\n\nSection 4: \n\t- RFC3552 requires all RFCs to have a Security Considerations section. Possibly, this section should be renamed as that. Or the security considerations should say that the entire RFC is about security?\n\t- The first sentence seems to suggest this is a security considerations section.\n\nSection 4.1:\n\t- Although \u00a73.3 mentions JWT, it is unclear if the other credential provisioning types are presumed to be types of \u201ctokens\u201d and therefore omitted from section 4.1. Or is this section intended to focus only on JWT tokens and OAuth2 provisioning flows?\n\t- It seems unexpected for an informational RFC to contain upper case normative.\n\nSection 5:\n\t- Inconsistent use of capitalization in header text. S/considerations/Considerations/\n\nSection 5.1:\n\t- \u201cThe outlined pattern\u2026\u201d is ambiguous as it refers to some other part of the document, but it is unclear which part.\n\t- Last paragraph: \u201cThe use of [RFC8414] or any other key distribution remains valid.\u201d It is unclear what part of RFC8414 is the subject of the sentence. It is also unclear for what purpose a \u201ckey distribution\u201d remain valid. Section 3.2 didn\u2019t identify \u201ckey distribution\u201d as a possible credential type or format yet it seems to be related to credential issuance / provisioning.\n\nIf this document chooses to have a separate security considerations section (Section 7?) it might include content that describes:\n\t- Expectations for integrity protection of the credential (or security techniques that ensure integrity of the access policy).\n\t\t- In transit.\n\t\t- At rest.\n\t- Credential lifecycle expectations - can it be updated and if so, what security capabilities are assumed to be at play to ensure update integrity?\n\t- What authority / privileges does the workload have in terms of the credential lifecycle - if any?\n\t- How does the workload itself get provisioned?\n\t- How is a workload confidentiality protected? Note: the WIMSE arch talks about TLS/SPIFFE, but it is unclear if TLS/SPIFFE is a \u201ccurrent practice\u201d.\n\nMy intention in reviewing the current practices draft was to highlight gaps in security based on current practice to motivate the need for better practices and security mechanisms. I\u2019m finding it difficult to approach the document because it seems to both describe current practice, but also specific new practice; and it doesn\u2019t give equal attention to the various types of credentials both in terms of describing current practice and in specifying new practice.\n\nI'm happy to help improve this draft.\n",

What is it trying to say?\n\nThe title \"Workload Identity Practices\" feels imprecise - it leads me to think that the document either will list (best) practices or different patterns related to Workload Identity\". Which is not what it does.\n\nThe abstract is also quite confusing, it starts by addressing secret sprawl, then states \"the industry has shifted towards a federation-based approach where credentials of the underlying workload platform are used as assertions towards an OAuth authorization server, leveraging the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication [RFC7521], specifically [RFC7523].\". In my opinion the document states this very bluntly but it hasn't given me any context besides a brief reference to secret sprawl.\nThe second paragraph of the abstract refers to three sections of the document but this is not terribly helpful because the reader has not yet read the document.\nIn general I feel that this abstract doesn't fulfill the requirements specified in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7322.html#section-4.3. It doesn't summarize and give a clear understanding of the document.\n\nReading the document itself it seems to me that it's actually describing a (proposed) WIMSE pattern of using tokens (eg, google/aws workload identity token, kubernetes service account token) as an assertion towards an AS in a different trust domain using an assertion_grant flow. I'm not clear if the document also proposes this pattern within the same trust domain.\n\nI feel that the abstract needs to be rewritten, inline with RFC7322 \"provides a concise and comprehensive overview of the purpose and contents of the entire document\".\n\nI also find that a lot of the most practical actionable information is \"buried\" in Appendix A. This appendix is the part that gives me most context and practical information on what the document is trying to achieve.",

The overall structure is better, it's much clearer what is the purpose and the abstract makes sense. \n\nI have a couple of thoughts:\n1. Is it possible to change the document name to something more precise at this point? Maybe \"Workload Identity Current Industry Practices\"? To call it \"Workload Identity Practices\" still feels very imprecise to me, it doesn't say much about anything.\n2. Is it really necessary to \"import\" half the SPIFFE spec into this spec? Maybe a briefer overview with a reference to SPIFFE docs? If this section had something important to say about *how current SPIFFE practices relates to WIMSE and this document*, it might justify such a lengthy section, but I don't really see that at the moment.\n3. On kubernetes would it be worth mentioning this quirk https://stackoverflow.com/a/69581779? Quick summary the default TTL for a k8s SA token appears to be 3607 seconds, and k8s will renew the token each hour but the \"exp\" is always set to **ONE YEAR**. This \"quirk\" has existed in kubernetes for years now.\n\nA suggestion: consider adding an Istio section. Istio actually uses an interesting mechanism with Envoy to establish mTLS between workloads and these x.509 certificates actually have SPIFFE IDs. So these certificates can be considered Workload Identity Credentials. This even work multi-cluster if you have a control plane configured for shared CA root.",

I checked and we roughly introduce SPIFFE as much as we introduce K8S, Cloud providers and CI/CD/build systems. We mentioned SPIFFE also add the local APIs but only briefly. Do you think we should generally cut the introductions and refer to documentation instead?\n\n3. Thank you for sharing this. I'm not an expert but I always thought this to be only a migration thing to gradually migrate clusters away from unlimited/1year expirations?\n\nRegarding Istio: I'm indecisive about it. On one hand service meshes are a very common pattern that is deployed widely. On the other hand it is totally opaque to the workload, they cannot get any token from it.

What do you think?\n\nI agree that the mechanism is quite different. I would argue that the XFCC headers can be considered a type of token, but they are not signed of course. The trust would not be in a signature, rather you put trust in the istio service mesh and your platform (headers can't be overwritten or tampered with, you trust that istio does proper certificate validation, istio itself won't be compromised, etc).\n\n\"workload to workload auth with JWT and with mTLS\" is clearly the purpose of https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-03.html. Maybe that's a good point, talking about istio is more in the realm of that specification. It's not directly applicable to \"industry practices for **workload identity**\". Istio does use SPIFFE IDs to identify workloads (actually k8s service accounts), but the primary use case is definitivey Workload to Workload Authentication (in the service mesh).",

Workloads can use this token to authenticate themselves towards APIs of the platform control plane. Even though this token is used for access it can be more considered an ID Token rather than an Access Token in the OAuth context. Workloads don't get issued a refresh token nor does authorization or consent play a role. It is merely a proof that the workloads is who it claims to be. Workloads have various options available to retrieve such token from the Kubernetes platform, for example via a `TokenRequest` API invoked by business logic or `Token volume projection` which mounts the token into the file system of the workloads and keeps it up to date there. `Token volume projection` having the advantage of not requiring any manual effort by the application besides reading a file.\r\n```",

This will include AWS, GCP and more and also will sound more familiar with readers that aren't as involved into specifics of OAuth such as the assertion framework. \r\n\r\nA new section called \"usage patterns\" aims to highlight various patterns workloads use their identity with, starting at accessing resources within the platform (no federation required) to federating to external Identity Providers and using a federated identity to access resources.",
